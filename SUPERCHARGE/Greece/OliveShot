Chronic inflammation is thought to be among the leading drivers of many diseases.

This includes cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, Alzheimer's, arthritis and even obesity.

Olive oil can reduce inflammation, which may be one of the main reasons for its health benefits.

The main anti-inflammatory effects are mediated by the antioxidants. Key among them is oleocanthal, which has been shown to work similarly to ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug (10).

Some scientists estimate that the oleocanthal in 50 ml (3.4 tablespoons) of extra virgin olive oil has a similar effectiveness as 10% of the adult dosage of ibuprofen (11).

There are also studies suggesting that oleic acid itself, the main fatty acid in olive oil, can reduce levels of important inflammatory markers like CRP (2, 3).

One study also showed that olive oil antioxidants can inhibit some genes and proteins that drive inflammation (12).
